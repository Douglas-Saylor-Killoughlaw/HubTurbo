Once you have everything, grab the installer [here](https://github.com/HubTurbo/AutoUpdater/releases/download/V0.9.0/HubTurbo.jar). It will install HubTurbo and keep it up-to-date.

When it starts, you'll be presented with a login dialog. Point HubTurbo at the repository you want it to use by providing the repository URL and your GitHub account details.

Using HubTurbo
---
[Let's start with the basics of navigating GitHub using HubTurbo](https://github.com/HubTurbo/HubTurbo/wiki/UI-Basics), then move on to HubTurbo's more advanced features!

### [Panels](https://github.com/HubTurbo/HubTurbo/wiki/Working-with-Panels)

HubTurbo presents issues in *panels*, which are like little windows into GitHub's issue tracker. You can have as many panels as you want and can easily customise them to enhance your workflow.

### [Filters](https://github.com/HubTurbo/HubTurbo/wiki/Filtering-Issues)

HubTurbo uses the same search syntax as GitHub does for its panels, but takes it a step further, by extending it with more qualifiers and operators! You'll be able to precisely express queries, narrowing down the issues in panels to only the ones you're interested in.
