Here we'll get an overview of the essential parts of HubTurbo's user interface.

HubTurbo's interface is split in two. These parts are the **panel view** and the **browser view**.

The **panel view** displays panels of issues, serving as an overview of the issue tracker. HubTurbo is meant to be used alongside GitHub, so the **browser view** generally shows a GitHub page; for example, clicking on an issue in a panel will navigate to its page in the browser view.

The general workflow is to switch back and forth between the two windows as needed, going to the panel view for an overview of the issue tracker, and to the browser view to make changes to issues.

Other user interface elements are more typical: the **menu** contains ways to add new panels, navigate to different pages in the browser view, and other application-level operations, and the **repository** dropdown allows you to change the *default repository* that HubTurbo is viewing. HubTurbo can be viewing many repositories at once; the default repository is just the one used when no repository is explicitly specified.

An **issue panel** provides a view into a section of the issue tracker. It displays **issue cards** according to the filter set in it. The filter can help you [refine](https://github.com/HubTurbo/HubTurbo/wiki/Filtering-Issues) the portion of the issue tracker that you're interested in, so you can get to the information you need faster. You can also have [as many panels as you want](https://github.com/HubTurbo/HubTurbo/wiki/Working-with-Panels), ensuring that all information relevant to you is shown at once.
