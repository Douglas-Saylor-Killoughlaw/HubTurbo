Any of the following will select an issue for viewing:

- Clicking on an issue.
- Navigating the issue list with the keyboard (refer [Keyboard shortcuts](keyboardShortcuts.md)).

## Watching Issues <a name="watching"></a>

If you are interested in an issue and would like to keep an eye on it, you can add it to a watch list panel.

To do that, right click the issue you are interested in, choose `Add to watch list`, then you can decide whether you want to add it to a new watch list panel or to an existing one.

You can learn more about the watch list panel [here](panels.md#watchlist).
