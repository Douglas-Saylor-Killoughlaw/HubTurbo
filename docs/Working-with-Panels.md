HubTurbo presents issues in vertically-arranged, flexible panels. You can create as many panels as you need, each with a different [filter](https://github.com/HubTurbo/HubTurbo/wiki/Filtering-Issues), representing a view in a particular part of the issue tracker. Knowing all the ways in which panels can be manipulated is essential to making HubTurbo a part of your workflow.

### Adding a New Panel <a name="add"></a>

Panels can be added easily, from the menu or via hotkeys. Hotkeys are available for adding both left and right of the current panel for efficiency.

- `Panels > Create Panel` to add a panel on the right.
    - `Ctrl + P` will do the same.

- `Panels > Create Panel (Left)` to add a panel on the left.
    - `Ctrl + Shift + P` will do the same.

### Closing a Panel <a name="close"></a>

- Click on the `x` button at the top of the panel.

- `Panels > Close Panel`
    - `Ctrl + W` will do the same.

### Reordering Panels <a name="reorder"></a>

Panels can be reordered simply by dragging them into the desired position.

- Click on the space next to the `x` button and move the panel to the left or right.

## Boards

A collection of panels is called a board. HubTurbo has ways to manage them as well.

### Saving a Board

- The current board will be saved when you quit the application.

- You may also save a board under a name via `Boards > Save`.

### Opening a Board

- Select the board you want to open under `Boards > Open`. It will clear the current board and open the requested one.

### Deleting a Board

- Select the board you want to remove under `Boards > Delete`.
