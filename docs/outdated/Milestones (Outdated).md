Milestones are another way of classifying labels, with added conveniences for managing a due date and progress of completion. They are meant to reflect project milestones.

# Associating Milestones with Issues <a name="associating"></a>

There are a number of ways to associate milestones with issues.

The easiest way is through the sidebar on the left: simply drag the milestone you want onto the appropriate issue.

For a greater degree of control, you could also click on the issue so it shows in the sidebar on the left. `Ctrl+M` or clicking on the Milestone field will bring up a dialog allowing you to select the right labels via a textual search.

The last way is to drag an issue across panels, utilising [filter expressions](Filtering-Issues/#application).
# Adding a Milestone <a name="add"></a>
1. Select _New Milestone_ button.
2. Enter new milestone title and set the due date _(optional)_ in the Add Milestone Dialog.
3. Select _Done_.

# Editing a Milestone <a name="edit"></a>
1. Right-click on a milestone to bring up context menu.
2. Select _Edit Milestone_ in context menu.
3. Edit milestone title and due date _(optional)_ in the Edit Milestone Dialog.
4. Select _Done_.

# Deleting a Milestone <a name="delete"></a>
1. Right-click milestone to bring up context menu.
2. Select _Delete Milestone_.

Note that there will be **no confirmation**, and **the milestone will be deleted immediately once you select _Delete Milestone_.** Deleting a milestone that is currently assigned to issues will cause it to be removed from those issues.
